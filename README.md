# Home Sales Challenge
Module 21 Challenge: Big Data

In this challenge we use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. 
We use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

Results: The run time for the query after cacheing the table dropped. After partionning on a selected field it went up.
